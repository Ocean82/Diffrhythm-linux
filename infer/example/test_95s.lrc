[00:00.00]Walking down this empty road
[00:04.00]Where the summer breeze once flowed
[00:08.00]In the shadows of the trees
[00:12.00]Chasing all my memories

[00:16.00]Every step I take today
[00:20.00]Points me to a brighter way
[00:24.00]No more looking at the past
[00:28.00]This is where it starts at last

[00:32.00]I'm finding my rhythm now
[00:36.00]And I'm making a silent vow
[00:40.00]To keep on moving to the light
[00:44.00]Everything will be alright

[00:48.00]The sun is rising in the sky
[00:52.00]A new beginning's passing by
[00:56.00]With every beat within my heart
[01:00.00]I'm ready for a brand new start

[01:04.00]I'm finding my rhythm now
[01:08.00]And I'm making a silent vow
[01:12.00]To keep on moving to the light
[01:16.00]Everything will be alright

[01:20.00]Yes it's alright
[01:24.00]In the golden light
[01:28.00]Everything's alright
[01:32.00]Tonight
